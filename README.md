# My portfolio site
The portfolio page was created during the WTF Co ten frontend course. Contains a list of my skills and a list of repositories in my GitHub account. I invite you to read it and contact me.

## How to run my site locally

Follow the instructions below:

`npm install -g gulp-cli`

`npm install`

`gulp`

To publish your page using github pages use `npm run deploy`
